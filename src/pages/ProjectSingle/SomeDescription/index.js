                        <p>The textured façade is made up of a series of projecting volumes, which articulate the different apartments externally and allow residents to identify their own home – a personal approach that is echoed throughout the development. The accommodation is grouped around central cores and ranges from three to four-bedroom apartments, both single and duplex, enhancing the sense of individuality and choice. Each balcony or glazed opening has been designed to capture a ‘contained view’ of the landscape and the apartments are configured in such a way that privacy is assured, yet natural light, views and external space are optimised.</p>
