            content: '<p>Foster + Partners architects and engineers have developed a radical new plan to build a temporary double-decker crossing within the existing structure of Hammersmith Bridge in London, which has been closed fully on safety grounds since 13 August this year. The proposal which has been presented to the Hammersmith & Fulham Council envisages pedestrians, cyclists and, potentially, motor vehicles being able to use the bridge during its repair and restoration. A new raised truss structure would be built above the existing road deck, featuring a lower level for pedestrians and cyclists and an upper level for cars and buses.</p> <p>The raised deck would enable existing approach routes for traffic to be used, causing minimum disruption for residents on both banks of the river. The structure will also provide support for the bridge as well as a safe platform for restoration work to be carried out. The new truss structure would be assembled in two halves and launched from each side over the existing road surface. It will be supported on each bank and at the two existing piers. As a result, there will be no added load on the existing bridge deck. Elements of the Grade 2* listed bridge that need repair, including pedestals, anchors and chains, would be lifted away and transported by barges to an off-site facility for safe repair and restoration.
